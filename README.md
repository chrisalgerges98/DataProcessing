# DataProcessing

This repository contains the food prices dataset of the World Food Project and scripts used to analyize this dataset.
We added an refugee dataset of the UN to relate it with the food prices.

This repository also contains the charts used for the analysis of the data and a website hosted by Github Pages to present the results.
